Including  and excluding rules
==============================

You can include or exclude particular rules using rule name or id.
Rules are matched in similar way how Robot Framework :code:`include/exclude` arguments.

Described examples::

    robocop --include missing-keyword-doc test.robot

All rules will be ignored except ``missing-keyword-doc`` rule::

    robocop --exclude missing-keyword-doc test.robot

Only ``missing-keyword-doc`` rule will be ignored.

Robocop supports glob patterns::

    robocop --include *doc* test.robot

All rules will be ignored except those with *doc* in its name (like ``missing-doc-keyword``, ``too-long-doc`` etc).

You can provide list of rules in comma separated format or repeat the argument with value::

    robocop --include rule1,rule2,rule3 --exclude rule2  --exclude rule1 test.robot

You can also use short names of options::

    robocop -i rule1 -e rule2 test.robot

Ignore rule from source code
----------------------------

Rules can be also disabled directly from Robot Framework code. It is similar to how :code:`# noqa` comment works for
most linters.

It is possible to disable rule for particular line or lines::

    Some Keyword  # robocop: disable:rule1,rule2

In this example no message will be printed for this line for rules named ``rule1``, ``rule2``.

You can disable all rules with::

    Some Keyword  # robocop: disable

Ignore whole blocks of code by defining a disabler in the new line::

    # robocop: disable=rule1

All matched rules will be disabled until ``enable`` command::

    # robocop: enable=rule1

    or:

    # robocop: enable

Ignored blocks can partly overlap. Rule name and rule id can be used interchangeably.

It is possible to ignore whole file if you start file with ``# robocop: disable`` and won't provide
``# robocop: enable`` before end of file.

Examples::

    *** Test Cases ***
    Some Test  # robocop: disable=missing-doc-test-case
        Keyword 1
        Keyword 2
        Keyword 3

    *** Keywords ***
    # robocop: disable
    Keyword 1
        Log  1

    Keyword 2
        Log  2

    # robocop: enable

In this example we are disabling ``missing-doc-test-case`` rule in 2nd line of the file.
Also we are disabling all rules for ``*** Keywords ***`` section.
