# PyCharm

There are two options available to display Robocop results in PyCharm:

- using Qodana plugin with [SARIF](../linter/reports/sarif.md) report
- using Robocode plugin (recommended)

[Robotcode](https://robotcode.io/) provides full support for Robot Framework and also includes Robocop support.
Robocop is run as a separate process, and results are displayed in the IDE.

See plugin documentation for more details.
