## New rules

### ``deprecated-singular-header`` (#697)

Robot Framework 5.1 starts deprecating the singular header forms (such as ``*** Setting ***`` or ``*** Test Case ***``).
Such headers will raise deprecation warning and eventually will not be supported in the future Robot Framework versions.
``deprecated-singular-header`` warns you if you use singular header form.

## Fixes

- unrecognized header is now only reported by ``parsing-error`` and not by ``duplicated-setting`` (#683)
- empty lines and standalone comments are now not counted towards keyword/test length in ``too-long-test-case`` and ``too-long-keyword`` rules (#671)

## Issue end location (#290)

Our test framework now supports custom format of the issue - which should help with enhancing the precision of the reported
issues. The following rules have improved precision (reported beginning and end of the rule) in this release:

- ``invalid-argument``
