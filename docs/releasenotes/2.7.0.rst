Robocop 2.7.0
================

You can install the latest available version by running::

    pip install --upgrade robotframework-robocop

or to install exactly this version::

    pip install robotframework-robocop==2.7.0


File configuration changes
---------------------------

We addressed several smaller issues and incoherence with Robocop file configuration.

Overriding default configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you're using Robocop from the command line it reads both the cli arguments and default
configuration file (found in the disk). The default configuration file (either ``.robocop`` or ``pyproject.toml`` file)
is used as a base that can be overridden by the cli arguments. The problem with the previous implementation was
that when user specified path to argument file in the cli::

    robocop --argumentfile myconfig.txt

Robocop would read both default configuration file and configuration file from ``--argumentfile``. Now it will read
default configuration file only if ``-A / --argumentfile`` options are not used.

Language header support (#696)
--------------------------------

Robot Framework 6.0 allows to set source language using language headers at the beginning of the file::

    language: de

    *** Einstellungen ***

Following changes focus on improving support for the language header.

Also, ``ignored-data`` rule now properly ignores language header if it's in the first line of the file.

Precommit configuration file
-----------------------------
Starting from this release it is possible to use Robocop in precommit using Robocop version instead of the repository url::

    repos:
    - repo: https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-robocop
        rev: 2.7.0
        hooks:
        - id: robocop
            name: robocop
