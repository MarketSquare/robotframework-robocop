File configuration changes
---------------------------

We addressed several smaller issues and incoherence with Robocop file configuration.

Overriding default configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you're using Robocop from the command line it reads both the cli arguments and default
configuration file (found in the disk). The default configuration file (either ``.robocop`` or ``pyproject.toml`` file)
is used as a base that can be overridden by the cli arguments. The problem with the previous implementation was
that when user specified path to argument file in the cli::

    robocop --argumentfile myconfig.txt

Robocop would read both default configuration file and configuration file from ``--argumentfile``. Now it will read
default configuration file only if ``-A / --argumentfile`` options are not used.

Language header support (#696)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robot Framework 6.0 allows to set source language using language headers at the beginning of the file::

    language: de

    *** Einstellungen ***

Following changes focus on improving support for the language header.

- ``ignored-data`` rule now properly ignores language header if it's in the file's first line
