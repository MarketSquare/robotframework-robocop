You can install the latest available version by running::

    pip install --upgrade robotframework-robocop

or to install exactly this version::

    pip install robotframework-robocop==2.7.0


File configuration changes
---------------------------

We addressed several smaller issues and incoherence with Robocop file configuration.

Overriding default configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you're using Robocop from the command line it reads both the cli arguments and default
configuration file (found in the disk). The default configuration file (either ``.robocop`` or ``pyproject.toml`` file)
is used as a base that can be overridden by the cli arguments. The problem with the previous implementation was
that when user specified path to argument file in the cli::

    robocop --argumentfile myconfig.txt

Robocop would read both default configuration file and configuration file from ``--argumentfile``. Now it will read
default configuration file only if ``-A / --argumentfile`` options are not used.
