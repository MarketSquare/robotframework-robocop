Nested argument files (#770)
-----------------------------

Nesting argument files was not allowed before. Now it is possible to import other argument file in the argument file::

    --include some-rule
    --argumentfile base_argument_file.txt

Relative paths in the argument files (#693)
-----------------------------------------------

Argument files now support relative paths. The support was added for the ``pyproject.toml`` files before but it was
missing from the argument files.

It means that argument file can have paths relative to the argument file location::

    content of config/argumentfile.txt:

    --output robocop_output.txt # it will now refer to config/robocop_output.txt
    --ext-rules robocop/rules.py # it will now refer to config/robocop/rules.py

Bugs
-----

Robot Framework 6.0 introduces some minor changes that affected our rules:

- not supported settings uses different error message in Robot Framework now. That's why ``setting-not-supported``
  failed to catch those errors and they were reported as ``parsing-error`` instead
- Task header now uses distinct token type internally. This causes Robocop to not recognize ``both-tests-and-tasks``
  issues

Rules
-----

New W0204 `missing-doc-resource-file` rule that checks if documentation is missing in a resource file. (#776)
