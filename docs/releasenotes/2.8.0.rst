Bugs
-----

Robot Framework 6.0 introduces some minor changes that affected our rules:

- not supported settings uses different error message in Robot Framework now. That's why ``setting-not-supported``
  failed to catch those errors and they were reported as ``parsing-error`` instead
- Task header now uses distinct token type internally. This causes Robocop to not recognize ``both-tests-and-tasks``
  issues
