Nested argument files (#770)
---------------------------

Nesting argument files was not allowed before. Now it is possible to import other argument file in the argument file::

    --include some-rule
    --argumentfile base_argument_file.txt

Relative paths in the argument files (#693)
-----------------------------------------------

Argument files now support relative paths. The support was added for the ``pyproject.toml`` files before but it was
missing from the argument files.

It means that argument file can have paths relative to the argument file location::

    content of config/argumentfile.txt:

    --output robocop_output.txt # it will now refer to config/robocop_output.txt
    --ext-rules robocop/rules.py # it will now refer to config/robocop/rules.py
