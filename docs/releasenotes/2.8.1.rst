Robocop 2.8.1
================

Recent update to configuration argument files introduces a bug where option values were appended by a path to the
argument file directory. It should be fixed with this release.

You can install the latest available version by running::

    pip install --upgrade robotframework-robocop

or to install exactly this version::

    pip install robotframework-robocop==2.8.1
