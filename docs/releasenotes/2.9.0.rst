Robocop 2.9.0
================

This version of Robocop hugely improves the experience of using Robocop
within the IDEs by fixing the locations of rule violations in code, which
in turn results in correct underlining of the issues.

    You can install the latest available version by running::

        pip install --upgrade robotframework-robocop

    or to install exactly this version::

        pip install robotframework-robocop==2.9.0

Precise locations of the rule violations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main improvement focused around adjusting the locations
where the rules are violated in the code. More specifically, it improves
where the rule violation starts and ends, meaning that the precise position
is now defined correctly. Thanks to that, the LSP will correctly pass that
information to the IDE you're using and will underline every place that
needs your attention.
