Robocop 3.0.0
================

This version of Robocop hugely improves the experience of using Robocop
within the IDEs by fixing the locations of rule violations in code, which
in turn results in correct underlining of the issues.

Additionally, we bumped the versions of the dependencies up.

    You can install the latest available version by running::

        pip install --upgrade robotframework-robocop

    or to install exactly this version::

        pip install robotframework-robocop==3.0.0

Precise locations of the rule violations (#290)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main improvement focused around adjusting the locations
where the rules are violated in the code. More specifically, it improves
where the rule violation starts and ends, meaning that the precise position
is now defined correctly. Thanks to that, the LSP will correctly pass that
information to the IDE you're using and will underline every place that
needs your attention.

Bumped dependencies (#792)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There were some compatibility issues due to outdated packages.
Now, all of them are updated.

Removed packaging dependency (#742)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``packaging`` dependency brings a lot of other dependencies and often caused
compatibility issues for us. We only used it for its versioning module when
deciding if the Robocop rule should be enabled for given Robot Framework rule.
That's why we have decided to remove the dependency and rewrite version handling
in the Roocop.

Improved internal quality (#652)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A couple of new GitHub Actions have been added to our GitHub CI.
New Black action now scans Robocop code to ensure code quality.
There is also new pre-commit job and additional unit tests.

`misaligned-continuation-row` rule now ignores documentation by default (#789)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a new `ignore_docs` parameter added to 1015
`misaligned-continuation-row` rule set to `True` by default, which means
that any violation of this rule within the Documentation will be ignored.
If you want to detect the violations in the Documentation setting or section,
configure this rule with `-c 1015:ignore_docs:False`.

Deprecated parameters of W1008 `bad-indent rule` and 
new E1017 rule for bad indentation in code block (#793)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Old `bad-indent` rule has been split into two:
- the old one W1008 `bad-indent` stays, but it will only detect under- or
  over-indented code. The `ignore_uneven` and `strict` are no longer available,
  but `indent` parameter remains the same, with a new default value of -1,
  which makes it being ignored by default.
- the new E1017 `bad-block-indent` rule that detects invalid indentation
  inside code block like FOR loops or TRY-EXCEPT statements.

Using `bad-indent` rule now prints a deprecation warning in the console
that suggests to replace old parameters with new E1017 rule. The parameters
are still accepted, but they no longer control the behavior of W1008 rule.
The warning will disappear in the next major release.

Also, there was a bug (#793) that prevented the severity of the old `bad-indent`
rule from being configured. It is now fixed and the rule can be configured.
