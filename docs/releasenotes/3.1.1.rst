Fixes
=====

Fix for escaped variable syntax crashing Robocop (#829)
-------------------------------------------------------

The escaped variables syntax like ``$escaped`` or ``\${escaped`` caused fatal exception with variable naming rules.

Fix for invalid variable syntax crashing Robocop (#830)
-------------------------------------------------------

The invalid variable syntax caused fatal exception with ``section-variable-not-uppercase`` rule. Now following code
should work with Robocop::

    *** Variables ***
    ${not    closed

Note that this code is not valid and Robocop raises ``parsing-error`` for this. This fix only addressed issue with
crashing when parsing such code.
