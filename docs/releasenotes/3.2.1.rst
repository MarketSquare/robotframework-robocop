Fixes
=====

Fix for variables in loop not detected as used (#868)
-------------------------------------------------------

Following code should not report not used variable anymore::

    Keyword
        ${counter}    Set Variable    1
        WHILE    ${counter} < 10
            Log To Console    ${counter}
            ${counter}    Evaluate ${counter} + 1  # used in loop
        END

Fix for variables used with math operations not detected as used (#870)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following code should not report not used variable anymore::

    Simple Operations
        ${sum}    Calculate    ${random}
        ${var}    Set Variable    ${sum%11}
        ${var}    Set Variable    ${sum + 11}
        ${var}    Set Variable    ${sum - 11}
        ${var}    Set Variable    ${sum * 11}
        Log    ${var}

Fix for W1003 rule to simplify counting space between sections (#861)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Previously, the comments between sections were ignored and each empty line
was counted towards the 2 space requirement. That means that this code:

    *** Variables ***
    ${VAR}     value

    # Comment

    *** Test Cases ***
    Some Test Case
    No Operation

reported no issue, because of 2 empty lines between sections.

When one empty lines was added before the Test Cases section, it was considered a violation,
while it still looked fine. We decided to simplify the rule, and now it only counts
empty lines after the last piece of text in the section, comments included.
