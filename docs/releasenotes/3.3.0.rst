Rule changes
============

New rule for detecting not supported settings in resource files (#827)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

According to the official RF User Guide:

"Setting section in resource files can contain only import settings (Library, Resource, Variables)
and Documentation. The Variable section and Keyword section are used exactly the same way
as in test case files.

New E0416 ``invalid-setting-in-resource`` rule detects unsupported
settings in resource files.

Other features
==============

Reports refactor (#834)
-----------------------

Our internal reports structure was refactored to make it easier to maintain and develop it in the future. Now,
each report is stored in a separate file in Robocop project. From the user's perspective, reports should work
the same as before.
