Rule changes
============

New rule for detecting not supported settings in resource files (#827)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

According to the official RF User Guide:

"Additionally, the Setting section in resource files can contain only
import settings (Library, Resource, Variables) and Documentation.
The Variable section and Keyword section are used exactly the same way
as in test case files."

New E0416 ``invalid-setting-in-resource`` rule detects unsupported
settings in resource files.
