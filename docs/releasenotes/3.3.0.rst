Rule changes
============

New rule for detecting not supported settings in resource files (#827)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

According to the official RF User Guide::

    "Setting section in resource files can contain only import settings (Library, Resource, Variables)
    and Documentation. The Variable section and Keyword section are used exactly the same way
    as in test case files."

New E0416 ``invalid-setting-in-resource`` rule detects unsupported
settings in resource files.

New rule that suggests using task- or test-related settings for corresponding sections (#522)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the file contains ``*** Task ***`` section, it is recommended to use settings like ``Task Setup``,
``Task Teardown``, ``Task Template``, ``Task Tags`` and ``Task Timeout`` instead of their `Test` variants.
Similarly, use test-related settings when using ``*** Test Cases ***`` section.

A new rule W0326 ``mixed-task-test-settings`` is introduced to cover these cases.
