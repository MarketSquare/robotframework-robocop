Rule changes
============

New rule for detecting not supported settings in resource files (#827)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

According to the official RF User Guide:

"Setting section in resource files can contain only import settings (Library, Resource, Variables)
and Documentation. The Variable section and Keyword section are used exactly the same way
as in test case files.

New E0416 ``invalid-setting-in-resource`` rule detects unsupported
settings in resource files.

Other features
==============

New ``enabled`` rule parameter used to create rules disabled by default (#809)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Previously, all defined rules were enabled by default and could be disabled using ``--exclude`` option (or by
using ``--include`` if not listed with the option). It is now possible to create a rule disabled by default using
new parameter, ``enabled``::

    rules = {
        "1155": Rule(
            rule_id="1155",
            name="custom-rule",
            msg="Custom rule message",
            severity=RuleSeverity.INFO,
            enabled=False,
            docs="""
            Custom rule description.
            """,
        )
    }

Such rules can be enabled when called explicitly with ``--include`` option::

    robocop --include custom-rule .

 or by configuring ``enabled`` parameter directly::

    robocop --ext-rules custom_rules.py -c custom-rule:enabled:True .
