Fix for W1003 rule to simplify counting space between sections (#861)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Previously, the comments between sections were ignored and each empty line
was counted towards the 2 space requirement. That means that this code:

```
*** Variables ***
${VAR}     value

# Comment

*** Test Cases ***
Some Test Case
    No Operation
```

reported no issue, because of 2 empty lines between sections.

When one empty lines was added before the Test Cases section, it was considered a violation,
while it still looked fine. We decided to simplify the rule, and now it only counts
empty lines after the last piece of text in the section, comments included.
