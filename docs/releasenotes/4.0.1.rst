Fixes
=====

Fix ``possible-variable-overwriting`` with different types of assignments (#913)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables using assignments signs were not parsed correctly and raised false positive
I0316 ``possible-variable-overwriting``.

For example, following code will not be reported by Robocop with the fixed version::

    *** Test Cases ***
    Test
        [Documentation]    doc
        ${v} =    No Operation
        Log    ${v}
        ${v} =    No Operation
        Log    ${v}

Also, ``possible-variable-overwriting`` now supports item assignments introduced in Robot Framework 6.1.
