``argument-overwritten-before-usage`` rules. Also, rule severity threshold now properly respects threshold filter.

Most important changes
======================

Documentation makeover (#916, #917)
------------------------------------
Our external documentation (https://robocop.readthedocs.io/) got a makeover that hugely improves navigating and
readability of the documentation. It now has a better structure, proper formatting, more clear sentences,
some new articles describing how Robocop works, rewritten rules explanation and emojis!

Fixes
=====

Enable ``if-can-be-used`` rule for Robot Framework 5+
-----------------------------------------------------

I0908 ``if-can-be-used`` was incorrectly enabled only for Robot Framework 4.*. It should now work for all >=4 versions.

External rules with non-Python files in the directory
-----------------------------------------------------

Robocop no longer reports a problem when loading the external rules from a directory that also contains non-Python files.

TRY/EXCEPT with shared variables scope for all branches (#925)
--------------------------------------------------------------

``variable-overwritten-before-usage`` will no longer be raised if the same variable names are used in different
branches of the ``TRY/EXCEPT`` block::

    *** Test Cases ***
    Example Test
        TRY
            ${value}    Possibly Failing Keyword
        EXCEPT
            ${value}    Set Variable    Keyword failed  # each TRY/EXCEPT/ELSE/FINALLY branch is now separate scope
        END
        Log To Console    ${value}

Rule severity threshold and global threshold filter (#930)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Rule that uses configured severity threshold (which can dynamically set rule severity) will no longer be filtered out
by global threshold ``-t/--threshold`` if rule default severity is lower than configured threshold.

For example, given rule ``file-too-long`` which has default Warning severity and following configuration::

    robocop -c file-too-long:severity_threshold:warning=600:error=700 -t E .

If file has more than 700 lines it should be reported as Error and not be filtered out by ``--threshold``.

``argument-overwritten-before-usage`` reported on test variables (#927)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

``argument-overwritten-before-usage`` should now clear arguments after keyword definition and it will not be
raised on the next test case using the same variable names.
