Fixes
=====

Enable ``if-can-be-used`` rule for Robot Framework 5+
---------------------------------------------

I0908 ``if-can-be-used`` was incorrectly enabled only for Robot Framework 4.*. It should now work for all >=4 versions.

External rules with non-Python files in the directory
-----------------------------------------------------

Robocop no longer reports a problem when loading the external rules from a directory that also contains non-Python files.
