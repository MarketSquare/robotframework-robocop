Fixes
=====
unused-variable when the variable is used in a Test Setup (#1062)
------------------------------------------------------------------

I0920 ``unused-variable`` was incorrectly reported if the variable was declared in the ``*** Variables ***`` section
and used in ``[Setup]``, ``[Teardown]`` or ``[Timeout]``.

Unexpected possible-variable-overwriting when elevating the scope an variable (#1053)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using ``VAR`` to elevate scope of the variable should not longer report I0316 ``possible-variable-overwriting``::

    *** Test Cases ***
    ${date}    Get Invoice Date
    VAR    ${DATE}    ${date}    scope=SUITE

Ignore variables in tags (#1059)
--------------------------------

Variables in tags are now not checked by tag rules but variable rules only.

For example::

    *** Test Cases ***
    Test with dynamic tag
        [Tags]    tag${GLOBAL VARIABLE}
        Step

Will now not raise W0601 ``tag-with-space`` since the space is inside variable name.

Tags in documentation
----------------------

Keyword tags can be specified on the last line of the documentation with ``Tags:`` prefix. It was handled by Robocop
already but not all tags were parsed correctly. For example::

    *** Keywords ***
    Already working
    [Documentation]    Tags: tag
        Step

    Multiple tags not supported before
    [Documentation]    Tags: tag1, tag2
        Step

    Multiple spaces not supported before
    [Documentation]    Tags:  tag1,    tag2
        Step
