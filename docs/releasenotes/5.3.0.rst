Rule changes
============

New unused-keyword rule (#1017)
-------------------------------

New I10101 ``unused-keyword`` community rule. This optional rule finds not used keywords defined in suites (robot files
with tests/tasks) or private keywords (keywords with ``robot:private`` tag).

For example::

    *** Test Cases ***
    Test that only non used keywords are reported
        Used Keyword

    *** Keywords ***
    Not Used Keyword  # this keyword will be reported as not used
        [Arguments]    ${arg}
        Should Be True    ${arg}>50

This rule will be developed in the future releases to cover other sources like resource files.

empty-variable can be now disabled for VAR (#1056)
--------------------------------------------------

I0912 ``empty-variable`` received new parameter ``variable_source`` which allows to enable the rule either only for
variables from ```*** Variables ***``` section or only ``VAR`` statements. By default it works on both.

New first-argument-in-new-line rule (#1001)
-------------------------------------------

New W1018 ``first-argument-in-new-line`` rule that checks if first argument is placed in the same line as
``[Argument]`` setting.

This rule covers Robot Framework Style Guide recommendation:
