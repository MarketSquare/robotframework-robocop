Rule changes
============

Allow to ignore run keywords in misaligned-continuation-row rule (#1065)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

W1015 ``misaligned-continuation-row`` detects if statements have misaligned rows::

    *** Keywords ***
    Misaligned example
        Keyword Call
        ...    first argument
        ...  second argument  # should be executed

This rules contradicts with how Robotidy aligns nested keywords with ``IndentNestedKeywords`` transformer to provide
extra alignment for readability purposes::

    SSH Wait For Device To Close SSH
        [Documentation]    Wait until SSH connection is closed by device.
        Wait Until Keyword Succeeds    2min    2s
        ...    Run Keyword And Expect Error    SSHException: SSH session not active
        ...        SSH Log FW Version    level=DEBUG

It is now possible to ignore run keywords by setting ignore_run_keywords to True::

    robocop -c misaligned-continuation-row:ignore_run_keywords:True src

By default it is disabled and run keywords are not ignored.

Fixes
=====

mixed-task-test-settings reporting task settings in __init__.robot file (#1101)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixes the issue where all task settings (such as ``Task Tags``) were reported as W0326 ``mixed-task-test-settings``
violation in files without Test or Task section.

unused-variable not detected within IF block (#1093)
----------------------------------------------------

If the variable was defined in the IF block, I0920 ``unused-variable`` was not reported even if variable was not used
anywhere::

    *** Test Cases ***
    Useless variable definition
        IF    True
             ${not_used}    Keyword Call
        END
