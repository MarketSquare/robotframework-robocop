Rules
=====

No global variable setters keywords (#1117)
--------------------------------------------

New rules that prohibits usage of variable setters with global scopes:

- W0929 ``no-global-variable``
- W0930 ``no-suite-variable``
- W0931 ``no-test-variable``

Using global variables might be necessary in some cases; however, they often result in code that is difficult
to understand. It's generally better to avoid them and instead use local variables.

Other
=====

Allow to overwrite documentation url (#1123)
--------------------------------------------

Robocop rules pointed to default rules documentation webpage (https://robocop.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rules_list.html).
Because of that, any custom rule incorrectly pointed out to the robocop rules page.

With this change, it's now possible to overwrite default rules documentation page using ``help_url`` argument::

    (...)
    "0601": Rule(
    rule_id="0601",
    name="custom-rule",
    msg="Custom message",
    severity=RuleSeverity.WARNING,
    help_url="https://www.your_company.com/robocop/rules/custom_rule"
    ),
