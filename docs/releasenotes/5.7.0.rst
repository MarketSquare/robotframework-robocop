Rules
=====

Undefined argument default (#1144)
----------------------------------

New rule E0932 ``undefined-argument-default``.

It is technically possible to define keyword argument default with empty string::

    *** Keywords ***
    My Keyword
    [Arguments]    ${argument_name}=

This syntax is unclear and it is better to explicitly state that the value is empty using built-in variable::

    *** Keywords ***
    My Keyword
    [Arguments]    ${argument_name}=${EMPTY}

New rule catches all occurrences where argument have empty default value and reports it.

Undefined argument value (#1149)
---------------------------------

New rule E0933 ``undefined-argument-value``.

Similarly to ``undefined-argument-default``, it is possible to pass value to argument with empty string::

    Keyword Call    argument_name=

It is recommended to use explicit value instead::

    Keyword Call    argument_name=${EMPTY}

Fixes
=====

Relative imports in custom rule folder (#1122)
-----------------------------------------------

Custom rules directory is now automatically added to python path. It allows to use relative imports inside custom
rules module.
