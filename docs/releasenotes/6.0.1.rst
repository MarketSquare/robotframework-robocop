Robocop 6.0.1
=============

return_status report fails with no attribute exception (#1357)
--------------------------------------------------------------

``return_status`` report should no longer fail with `has no exit_code` attribute error.

reports setting is ignored in the configuration file (#1358)
------------------------------------------------------------

Reports settings was not read correctly from the configuration file. It should now work as expected and reports
can be enabled from the configuration file.

configure from cli overwriting configuration file setting (#1360)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

``--configure`` can be now used in combination with the configuration file. Following configuration::

    > robocop check --configure line-too-long.line_length=140

    [tool.robocop.lint]
    configure = ["too-long-test-case.max_len=60"]

will result in Robocop using both configurations for ``line-too-long`` and ``too-long-test-case`` rules instead of only
using value from cli.

severity of the rule is not configurable (#1362)
------------------------------------------------

Rule severity can be now configured::

    robocop check --configure line-too-long.severity=e

Because of the attribute name clash for ``severity``, configuration for it was ignored before.
