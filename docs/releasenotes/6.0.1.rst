return_status report fails with no attribute exception (#1357)
--------------------------------------------------------------

``return_status`` report should no longer fail with `has no exit_code` attribute error.

reports setting is ignored in the configuration file (#1358)
------------------------------------------------------------

Reports settings was not read correctly from the configuration file. It should now work as expected and reports
can be enabled from the configuration file.
