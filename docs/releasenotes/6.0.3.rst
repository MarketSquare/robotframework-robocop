=============
Robocop 6.0.3
=============

Enabling reports in configuration does not work (#1369)
-------------------------------------------------------

Options common for whole run (such as reports) should be now loaded correctly from the configuration file.

robocop format --check always return 0 (#1371)
----------------------------------------------

``--check`` should now return correct exit code:

- 1 if ``--check`` is used and there are modified files
- 0 otherwise
- 2 on invalid configuration, robocop exceptions
