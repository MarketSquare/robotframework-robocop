Fixes
=====

Some options are not recognized when used with hyphens (#1378)
---------------------------------------------------------------

It should be possible to use both variants of options in configuration file - with underscores or with hyphens (
``target_version`` or ``target-version``).

Options with hyphens in name are ignored by migrate command (#1378)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Migrate command will now correctly convert option names that uses hyphens. For example ``ext-rules`` will be converted
to ``custom_rules``.
