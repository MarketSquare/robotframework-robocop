Robocop 6.1.1
=============

Incorrect language setting in formatter was silently ignored (#1387)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When configuring Robocop with invalid language (for example ``ple`` instead of ``pl``) Robocop issued decoding error
for each file instead of failing when reading the configuration file.

Our documentation also contained configuration examples with non-existing languages, which is now fixed.

Decoding errors do not display error message when linting (#1387)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Robocop issues decoding error when the Robot Framework fails to read the file. However had different behaviour for the
linter and formatter:

- linter only displayed simplified message
- formatter displayer error message which could be used to pinpoint what's the issue with the file or configuration

Output is not colorized with --diff option (#1389)
--------------------------------------------------

Robocop format should now colorize output when displaying differences before and after formatting.
``--color`` option should be now respected and will allow to disable colorized output:

- ``--no-color`` in the command line
-- or ``color = false`` in ``tool.robocop.format`` section of the configuration file
