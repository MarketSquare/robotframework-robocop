=============
Robocop 6.2.0
=============

Robot Framework 7.3 support (#1399)
-----------------------------------

Added support to most recent version of Robot Framework, which mostly includes updated to existing rules to handle
new variable type conversion syntax.

Use typer-slim dependency instead of typer (#1396)
---------------------------------------------------

Typer package requires some dependencies that are not required for Robocop to run. Instead, we will now use
typer-slip dependency which offers the same capabilities but with smaller size.
