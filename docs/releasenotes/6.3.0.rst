Robocop 6.3.0

SonarQube 10.3+ support (#1405)
--------------------------------

There are two major SonarQube versions supported with different report syntax. I have added option to configure used
Sonar Qube version (minimal supported) to adjust Robocop report syntax::

    robocop check --configure sonarqube.sonar_version=9.9

Allowed values:

- 10.3 (default)
- 9.9

Fixes
=====

SonarQube issue position fixes (#1400, #1404)
---------------------------------------------

SonarQube requires to follow its own set of rules when parsing the issue positions. Some rules need to be additionally
handled:

- SPC03, SPC04, SPC05, SPC09 rule positions will not have column position anymore
- LEN07, LEN08, LEN26, DUP rules will have adjusted end col

Variables attribute access recognized as variable sign (#1407)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed issue where variables with attribute access were incorrectly recognized as assignment sign by
``NormalizeAssignments`` formatter::

    ${variable}[attribute]    Save Value To Attribute

This could lead to either removal or duplication of variable attributes.
