=============
Robocop 6.5.1
=============

Rule location fixes (#1417)
---------------------------

Additional fixes to our rule locations. Following rule(s) have their location adjusted to real location:

- NAME04 ``underscore-in-keyword-name`` (which used last line in keyword for end column instead of keyword name)
- ARG07 ``arguments-per-line`` (which was offset by 1)
- SPC12 ``consecutive-empty-lines`` (which reported start/end column positions in SonarQube report)

--check overwriting files (#1415)
---------------------------------

``--check`` flag functionality was not ported correctly. Now Robocop with ``--check`` flag set will only modify files
if additional ``--overwrite`` flag is set (retaining behaviour before 6.0 release).
