Robocop 6.7.1

Configuring formatters with integer based parameters crashes Robocop (#1441)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running Robocop with older Robot Framework versions than 7.0 no longer crashes when trying to configure with
integer based parameter::

    robocop format AlignSettingsSection.fixed_width=30

The issue was coming from not supporting the Python extended typing in formatter definition::

    min_width: int | None = None

``|`` is not supported for Robot Framework < 7.0 and needs to be removed if you're using it in custom formatter::

    min_width: int = None
