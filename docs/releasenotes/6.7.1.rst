=============
Robocop 6.7.1
=============

Configuring formatters with integer based parameters crashes Robocop (#1441)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running Robocop with older Robot Framework versions than 7.0 no longer crashes when trying to configure with
integer based parameter::

    robocop format AlignSettingsSection.fixed_width=30

The issue was coming from not supporting the Python extended typing in formatter definition::

    min_width: int | None = None

``|`` is not supported for Robot Framework < 7.0 and needs to be removed if you're using it in custom formatter::

    min_width: int = None

Rules that use more granular version matching are ignored if target version is not set (#1466)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rules that require more granular version of Robot Framework (such as > 6.1) will no longer be silently ignored if
Robocop is executed on the same major version (6.1.1 for example) without target version set.

Importing external modules in custom rules with the same name as Robocop rules fails (#1467)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If custom rule used external module with the same name as one of Robocop rules categories, it failed on import::

    from deprecated import deprecated  # duplicates with robocop.linter.rules.deprecated.py

It was resolved by redesigning our rules importing logic to follow the same behaviour as formatter importer.
