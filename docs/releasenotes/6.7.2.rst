Robocop 6.7.2
=============

Assertion keywords reported as undefined-argument-value (#1390)
---------------------------------------------------------------

Assertion keywords used by popular ``AssertionEngine`` library were reported as ``undefined-argument-value`` errors:

```
 785 |   Get Text   ${selector}   *=   ${alv_check}
     |                            ^^ ARG04
```

Robocop should now ignore arguments that match following list: "==", "!=", "<", ">", "<=", ">=", "*=", "^=", "$=", "$".

SonarQube import issues with diagnostic outside physical locations (#1417)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed issues when reporting SPC10 ``too-many-trailing-blank-lines`` and LEN08 ``line-too-long`` outside physical
locations. Now it should only report start/end lines.
