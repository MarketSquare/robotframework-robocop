Improved comment handling in SplitTooLongLine formatter (#1444)
---------------------------------------------------------------

When formatting keyword call or ``VAR`` by ``SplitTooLongLine`` formatter, comments were moved above the statement,
for example::

    Long Keyword That Will Be Split    multiple   args  # comment

was formatted to::

    # comment
    Long Keyword That Will Be Split
    ...    multiple
    ...    args

This caused unindented effect where robocop disabler directives (e.g. ``# robocop: off``) were also moved above the
statement and no longer applied correctly.
To fix this, the comment-handling behavior has been updated. When a keyword call or VAR is formatted by the
``SplitTooLongLine`` formatter, all comments found within the statement are now kept together and attached to the
first line, for example:

    Long Keyword That Will Be Split  # comment
    ...    multiple
    ...    args

Disablers discoverable from the middle of comment
-------------------------------------------------

Previously, disabling linting or formatting required the disabler directive (e.g. ``# robocop: off`` or
``# robocop: fmt: off`` or ``noqa``) to appear at the beginning of a comment. Because of this, only the first disabler
in a comment would be recognized, for example::

    # only robocop: off=some-rule is recognized
    Keyword Call  # robocop: off=some-rule robocop: fmt: off
    # only noqa is recognized
    Keyword Call  # noqa fmt: off
    # nothing is recognized
    Keyword Call  # TODO: robocop: off

This limitation has been removed.
Disablers are now discoverable anywhere within a comment, so all directives in the examples above will be correctly
registered.

Overwrite mode not taken into account from the configuration file (#1478)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

``overwrite`` mode should now work properly when used from the configuration file::

    [tool.robocop.format]
    overwrite = false
