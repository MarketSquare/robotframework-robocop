=============
Robocop 6.8.0
=============

Disablers discoverable from the middle of comment
-------------------------------------------------

To disable linting or formatting you need to use ``# robocop: off`` or ``# robocop: fmt: off`` (or noqa) syntax.
This causes limitation where following comment only registered first disabler because every disabler was required to
start with ``#``::

    Keyword Call  # robocop: off=some-rule robocop: fmt: off
    Keyword Call  # noqa fmt: off

Now it's not required and above example will find all disablers. It also means that following will also work::

    Keyword Call  # some text robocop: off

Fixes
======

Overwrite mode not taken into account from the configuration file (#1444)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

``overwrite`` mode should now work properly when used from the configuration file::

    [tool.robocop.format]
    overwrite = false
