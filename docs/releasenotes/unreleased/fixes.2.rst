[Return] setting deprecation
----------------------------

``[Return]`` setting is now visibly deprecated. The internal Robot Framework model also changed and several Robocop
rules had to be updated:

- W0306 ``setting-name-not-in-title-case``
- W0319 ``deprecated-statement``
- W0510 ``number-of-returned-values``
- W0903 ``empty-return``
- W0919 ``unused-argument``
- I0920 ``unused-variable``
