Robot Framework 7.0 backward incompatible changes: Deprecation warnings when using Robocop
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Several rules started to issue additional deprecation warnings such as `'For.variables' is deprecated and will be
removed in Robot Framework 8.0. Use 'For.assign' instead`. Those warnings were for Robocop code only and should not
appear anymore.
