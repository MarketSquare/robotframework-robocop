.. _rule severity thresholds:

Rule Severity Thresholds
===========================
Selected rules can be configured to have different severity depending on the parameter value.

Using ``line-too-long`` as an example - this rule issues a warning when line length exceeds configured value (default ``140``).
It is possible to configure this rule to issue a warning for line length above 120 but an error for line length above 200.
We can use ``severity_threshold`` for this purpose.

::

    robocop -c line-too-long:line_length=120 -c line-too-long:severity_threshold:warning=120:error=200

It supports all default severity values:

  - error, e
  - warning, w
  - info, i

The issue needs to be raised in order for severity thresholds to be evaluated. That's why the parameter value needs to
be configured to raise an issue for at least one of our threshold ranges. In our example, we want to issue a warning
for line length above 120 - that's why we also configure ``line_length`` parameter to ``120``.

Following rules support ``severity_threshold``:
{% for checker_group in checker_groups %}
{% for rule_doc in checker_group[1] %}
{%- if rule_doc.severity_threshold is not none %}
  - :ref:`{{ rule_doc.name }}`
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
