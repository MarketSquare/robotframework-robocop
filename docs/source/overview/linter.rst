Lint your Robot Framework code by running::

    robocop check

It will recursively discover all ``*.robot`` and ``*.resource`` files in the current directory.

You can also use path specific path or paths::

    robocop check file.robot resources/etc test.robot

Robocop will also find and skip paths from `.gitignore` files. It is possible to configure how Robocop discover
files using various options - see :ref:`file_discovery`.

An example of the output the tool can produce::

    src\robot\htmldata\testdata\dir.suite\__init__.robot:16:1 SPC13 Multi-line statement with empty lines
        |
     14 | ...            === Title Level 3 ===
     15 | ...            Text for level 3
     16 |
        | ^ SPC13
     17 | ...            - *URL:*    http://robotframework.org
     18 | ...            - _Image:_  http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/martin-berube/character/48/Robot-icon.png
        |

    src\robot\htmldata\testdata\dir.suite\__init__.robot:38:1 DEPR02 'Force Tags' is deprecated since Robot Framework version 6.0, use 'Test Tags' instead
        |
     36 | Metadata       </script>     < &lt; </script>
     37 | Suite Setup    Log    higher level suite setup
     38 | Force Tags     i1    i2
        | ^^^^^^^^^^ DEPR02
        |

It is also possible to produce simple or grouped output - see :ref:`print_issues`.

Rules management
================

Select rules
------------

Rules can be selected or ignored using configuration.
Use ``--select`` and ``--ignore`` to select only rules to run or run all default rules except ignored ones:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Cli

        .. code:: shell

             robocop check --select rule1 --select rule2 --select rule3 --ignore rule2

    .. tab-item:: Configuration file

        .. code:: toml

            [robocop.lint]
            select = [
                "rule1",
                "rule2",
                "rule3"
            ]
            ignore = [
                "rule2"
            ]

In this example we are selecting ``rule1``, ``rule2`` and ``rule3``. Additionally ``rule2`` is ignored so Robocop
will only report ``rule1`` and ``rule3``.

More in :ref:`selecting-rules`.

Disabling rules from source code
--------------------------------

It is also possible to disable rule(s) from Robot Framework source code.
Use ``# robocop: off`` and optionally a rule that is going to be disabled, e.g.::

    *** Keywords ***
    Display Sentence
        [Arguments]      ${sentence}
        ${one-liner}     Parse Sentence  ${sentence}  # robocop: off=hyphen-in-variable-name
        Print To Welcome Page   ${one-liner}

Learn more about disablers here - :ref:`disablers`.

List rules
----------

To see the list of all the rules, run:

.. code:: shell

    robocop list rules

You can provide a ``--pattern`` to filter the rules that you are interested in, e.g.
``robocop list rules --pattern *doc*``.

Read more about how to list the rules in :ref:`list-rules`.

.. note::

    All Robocop rules are also nicely available here at :ref:`rules list`.

Handling output
===============

Robocop generates Diagnostic objects for each reported issue. Those objects are handled by reports - special classes
that can print issue information, output statistics or generate report file. Read more about reports at :ref:`reports`.

Default report that handles printing issues to standard output is ``print_issues`` report. You can use it to change
output from extended (print issues with source code) to grouped (group issues by file) or simple. There are also
options to configure output format. Read more at :ref:`print_issues`.

Language support
================

Robot Framework 6.0 added support for Robot settings and headers translation. Robocop will not recognize translated
names unless it is properly configured. You can supply language code or name in the configuration using
``--language / -l`` option:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Cli

        .. code:: shell

             robocop check --language fi --language pl

    .. tab-item:: Configuration file

        .. code:: toml

            [robocop.lint]
            language = [
                "fi",
                "pl"
            ]

Custom language file is currently not supported.
