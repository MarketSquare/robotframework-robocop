"""
Reports are configurable summaries after Robocop scan. For example, it can be a total number of issues discovered.
They are dynamically loaded during setup according to a command line configuration.

Each report class collects rules messages from linter and parses it. At the end of the scan it will print the report.

To enable report use ``-r`` / ``--report`` argument and the name of the report.
You can use separate arguments (``-r report1 -r report2``) or comma-separated list (``-r report1,report2``). Example::

    robocop --report rules_by_id,some_other_report path/to/file.robot

To enable all reports use ``--report all``.
