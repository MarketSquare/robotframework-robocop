        The line is too long.

        Comments with disabler directives (such as ``# robocop: off``) are ignored. Lines that contain URLs are also
        ignored.

        It is possible to ignore lines that match the regex pattern. Configure it using the following option::

            robocop check --configure line-too-long.ignore_pattern=pattern


        Configurables:
            severity_threshold
            line_length = 120
                type: int
